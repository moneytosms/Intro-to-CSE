## 9. Finding Your First CS Community

You don't need to wait until you're a "good programmer" to join the community. In fact, the earlier you do, the better. Whether you're looking to make friends, collaborate on projects, or just lurk and learn, there's a space for you.

---

### College Clubs and Hackathons

Your college is full of tech clubs : coding clubs, robotics teams, cybersecurity groups, and maybe even a club dedicated to memes with literature on the side.

These clubs often:

- Host workshops, CTFs (capture the flag events), or coding contests
- Let you collaborate on small internal projects
- Expose you to new tech beyond your curriculum

Hackathons are also a great entry point. Think of them as a coding sprint + sleepover + idea fest. No one expects you to build the next Google. Showing up and learning is enough.

> Don't overthink it. You don't need a LeetCode streak or fancy resume to show up. Just go.

---

### Discord Servers, GitHub Orgs, and Forums

The internet is full of nerds like us. Find your corner.

- **Discord Servers** - Tons of communities exist around languages, frameworks, or student groups or even your own college's private server (Yes we do have those, link to our socials will be listed below).
- **GitHub Organizations** - These are great if you're interested in open source. Join orgs that match your interests, and see how real-world projects are built.
- **Forums** - Reddit communities like r/learnprogramming or r/cscareerquestions can be gold mines (with occasional chaos).

---

### Attending Meetups and Online Events

Online tech meetups, webinars, or free workshops are happening all the time.

- Platforms like [Unstop](https://unstop.com/), [Devpost](https://devpost.com/), or [Hakc2Skill](https://hack2skill.com) regularly list events and hackathons for students.
- Many are beginner-friendly and don't require deep experience.

> If you're nervous, just join with your camera off and observe. You'll still learn a lot.

### What to Expect as a Beginner in Tech Spaces

Let's be real . At first, you might feel a bit lost. People will throw around tools, acronyms, and libraries like they're Pokémon moves.

But here's the truth:

- Everyone started somewhere
- Most of them still Google basic syntax
- Half of them still vibecode basic "helloworlds".
- You belong just as much as anyone else

Start small:

- Say hi in a Discord server
- Fork a GitHub repo and leave a comment
- Share an article you liked with someone

Communities aren't about showing off but they're about showing up.

> TL;DR: Find your people. Whether online or on campus, a good tech community is half knowledge, half motivation.

## 10. Tools and Resources

As you go deeper into CS, you'll realize a bunch of tools and platforms keep popping up. Not just in classes, but in projects, interviews, and job prep too. This is your beginner kit of resources and tools that'll stay relevant throughout your entire journey. Most people have their own database of this stuff, whether it be saved reels, Google docs or any other format.
